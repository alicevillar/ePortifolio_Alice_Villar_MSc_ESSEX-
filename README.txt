# ePortfolio - Alice Villar

This ePortfolio was carefully designed to demonstrate my studies over the PgDip in Computer Science at the University of Essex, UK. As you navigate through my ePortfolio, you will see my journey and studies of the material. The real value of this ePortfolio is in the learning experience and reflections over my personal development that are here documented.
