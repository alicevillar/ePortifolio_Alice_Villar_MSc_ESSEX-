									<strong>
										Big data, Cybersecurity and Cloud Computing are the most recent trends emerging in computer science:
									</strong>
									<br><br>
									<strong>Big data</strong> <br><br>
									Big data can be described as a field aimed to analyze, extract information from, and deal with data that are too large or complex to be dealt with by traditional data-processing application software. According to Berkovich and Liao (2012), Big Data refers to the flood of digital data from many digital earth sources, including sensors, digitizers, scanners, numerical modeling, mobile phones, Internet, videos, emails, and social networks. The data types include texts, geometries, images, videos, sounds, and combinations of each.  
									Big data has the following essential characteristics, using the famous 5 Vs. - Volume, Velocity, 
									Variety, Veracity, and Value: <br><br>
									<ol>
										<li>Volume: the large amount of data generated through websites, portals, and online applications.</li>
										<li>Velocity: the speed with which data are being generated.</li>
										<li>Variety: all the structured and unstructured data generated either by humans or by machines. <br>
											Structured data: texts, tweets, pictures & videos.<br>Unstructured data: emails, voicemails, hand-written text, ECG reading, audio recordings, etc.
										</li>
										<li>Veracity: the quality and value of the date.</li>
										<li>Value: the utility of the data.</li>
									</ol>
									<strong>Cybersecurity</strong><br><br>
									Cybersecurity aims at protecting systems, networks, programs, devices, and data from cyber-attacks. Digital attackers are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information, extorting money from users, or interrupting normal business processes. Cybersecurity seeks to reduce cyber-attacks' risk and protect against the unauthorized exploitation of systems, networks, and technologies.<br><br>
									<strong>Cloud Computing</strong><br><br>
									Cloud computing aims to deliver different services, such as tools and applications like data storage, servers, databases, networking, and software. Cloud computing has this name because the information accessed is found remotely in the cloud or a virtual space. Cloud computing is an excellent option for people and businesses for cost savings, increased productivity, speed and efficiency, performance, and security. Services can be both public and private. Public services are provided online for a fee, while private services are hosted on a specific client network. Cloud computing services include the following:
									<ul>
										<li>Email.</li>
										<li>Storage, backup, and data retrieval.</li>
										<li>Creating and testing apps.</li>
										<li>Analyzing data.</li>
										<li>Audio and video streaming.</li>
										<li>Delivering software on demand.</li>

									</ul>
									The major challenges and threats for a computer science professional are Data Leakage, Data Breaches, Cyber Terrorism and Hacking.
									<br><br><strong> Data Breaches & Data Leak </strong><br><br>
									Data leak is the unauthorized transmission of data from within an organization to an external destination. It refers to data that is transferred either electronically or physically. The data leak incidents normally happen online, via email and file transfer exchange. For instance, when an email is sent to the wrong person due to human error, or when some information is disclosed inadvertently in response to a request. Most of the data leak incidents are not intentional.<br>
									A data breach can be described as the intentional or unintentional release of private information to an untrusted environment.  ISO/IEC 27040 (“Information technology-Security techniques”) defines a data breach as the "compromise of security that leads to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to protected data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed." A data breach is therefore a direct attack on private data by an unauthorized entity. For instance, when hackers penetrate a computer database. In the case of Marriott International, hackers planted malware in the hotel's systems in 2014, but it was only discovered in 2018, exposing millions of guests' private data. This incident could have been detected sooner if Marriott had practiced standard security audits. The difference between data leak and data breach is that a data leak incident happens from the inside - out, while a data breach occurs from the outside - in. 
									<br><br> <strong>Cyberterrorism</strong> <br><br>
									The United States National Infrastructure Protection Center defined Cyberterrorism as: "a criminal act perpetrated by the use of computers and telecommunications capabilities resulting in violence, destruction, and/or disruption of services to create fear by causing confusion and uncertainty within a given population, with the goal of influencing a government or population to conform to a political, social, or ideological agenda.” The nature of cyberterrorism covers conduct involving computer or Internet technology that: (Hardy, 2017)
									<ol>
										<li>is motivated by a political, religious or ideological cause.</li>
										<li>is intended to intimidate a government or a section of the public to varying degrees.</li>
										<li>seriously interferes with infrastructure.</li>
									</ol>
									<strong>Hacking</strong> <br><br>
									Hacking is the unauthorised access to computer network security systems for some illicit purpose. To better understand hacking, one needs to first understand hackers. The term computer hacker can refer to any skilled computer programmer, but it became generally associated with "security hacker". This expression refers to someone who utilizes their technical knowledge of to break into a computer system and access data.

											</ol>
										</li>
									</ul>
									When a computer is connected to a network, it becomes subject to unauthorized access and vandalism, forms of cybercrime. Cybersecurity body of technologies, processes, and practices designed to protect computers, networks, and data from such attacks. <br>
									Attacks frequently focus on the software, but the hardware and the human users themselves can also be important weak points in the system. Securing systems may require interventions for all three. <br><br>
									<strong>Malware</strong> - malicious software <br><br>
									Many attacks incorporate the use of malware, a malicious software intentionally designed to cause damage. By contrast, software that causes unintentional harm due to some deficiency is typically described as a software bug. There is a wide variety of malware types, such as computer viruses, worms, Trojan horses and spyware. 
									<ul>
										<li><strong>Virus:</strong>  Self-replicating <br>A computer virus is a software usually hidden within another seemingly innocuous program. When the "host" program is executed, so is the virus. A computer virus can produce copies of itself and insert them into other programs or files. Some viruses perform devastating actions such as destroying data, degrading portions of the operating system, or other-wise corrupting data and other programs.</li>
										<li><strong>Worm:</strong>Self-replicating <br>A worm is a malware computer program that replicates itself and spread to other computers, often using a computer network to spread and using security failures on the target computer. A worms uses this machine as a host and then infects other computers. When these new worm-invaded computers are controlled, the worm infect other computers, and this behavior continues. (Zhang, et., al, 2015)<br>As viruses, worms can be designed merely to replicate itself or to perform more extreme harm. Worms normally cause at least some harm, even if only by consuming bandwidth. On the other hand, viruses almost always corrupt or modify files on a targeted computer. A characteristic of a worm is an explosion of the worm's replicated copies that degrade legitimate applications' performance and can ultimately over-load an entire network or internet. (Brookshear, 2018)</li>
										<li><strong>ansomware:</strong> aims to extort money from its victims <br>Ransomware is computer malware that that infects a computer and restricts users' access to it until a ransom is paid to unlock it. Ransomware variants have been observed for several years and often attempt to extort money from victims by displaying an on-screen alert.  It usually targets Word, text, and PDF files.</li>
										<li><strong>Rootkits: </strong> allows someone to gain control of a computer remotely<br>Rootkits are a type of malware that are designed so that they can remain hidden on your computer. But while you might not notice them, they are active. Rootkits give cybercriminals the ability to remotely control your computer. They install themselves as part of some other download, backdoor, or worm. They then take steps to prevent the owner from detecting their presence on the system. Once installed, Rootkits provide a bad actor with everything they need to take control of your PC and use it for DDoS or as a zombie computer.</li>
										<li><strong>Trojan horser: </strong> Backdoor access<br>A Trojan horse is a program that enters a computer system disguised as some desirable program, like a game or a useful utility package so it is willingly imported by the victim. Once in the computer, the Trojan horse performs harmful activities. Trojan horses often arrive in attachments in email messages. A Trojan horse usually carries a hidden destructive function that is activated when the application is started. In other cases, the Trojan horse might lie dormant until triggered by a specific event such as the occurrence of a preselected date.</li>
										<li><strong>Spyware:</strong> gather information <br>A spyware or “sniffing software” aims to gather information about a person or organization and send such data to another entity in a way that harms the user; for example, by violating their privacy or endangering their device's security. Some companies use spyware to build customer profiles, and in this context, it has questionable ethical merit. In other cases, spyware is used for blatantly malicious purposes, such as recording the symbol sequences typed at the computer's keyboard in search of passwords or credit card numbers. (Brookshear, 2018) 
											<ul style="list-style: circle;">
												<li><strong>Sniffing X Phishing:</strong> While sniffing via spyware aims to obtain information secretly, phishing is a technique of obtaining information explicitly by simply asking for it. Phishing is often carried out via email messages posing as a financial institution, a government bureau, or perhaps a law enforcement agency. The email asks the victim for information that will be used for hostile purposes.</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
									</ul>

									<strong>Problems associated with an abundance of unwanted messages:</strong><br><br>
									<ul>
										<li><strong>Denial of service (DoS)</strong></li>
									</ul>
									A Denial-of-Service (DoS) is an attack meant to shut down a machine or network, making it inaccessible to its intended users. It is typically accomplished by flooding the targeted machine or resource with superfluous messages in an attempt to overload systems and prevent some or all legitimate requests from being fulfilled. Denial of service attacks have been launched against large commercial webservers on the Internet to disrupt the company’s business and in some cases have brought the company’s commercial activity to a halt.This is why all computer users should install all security updates from their operating system, and to use appropriate protection. It has been estimated that once a computer is connected to the Internet, at least one intruder will attempt to exploit its existence within 20 minutes. (Brookshear, 2018)
									<ul style="list-style: circle;">
										<li>DoS attacks generally take one of two forms:  flood web services or crash them. Flooding is the more common form DoS attack.</li>
										<li>How the Denial-of-Service (DoS) work? An attacker usually plants software on numerous unsuspecting computers that will generate messages when a signal is given. Then, when the signal is given, all of these computers (sometimes called a botnet) swamp the target with messages. When the work of generating the attacks is distrib-uted over many hosts, this is known as a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack.</li>
									</ul>
									<ul>
										<li><strong>Spam</strong></li>
									</ul>
									Spam is any kind of unwanted, unsolicited digital communication that gets sent out in bulk.  Unlike a denial of service attack, the volume of spam is rarely sufficient to overwhelm the computer system. Instead, the effect of spam is to overwhelm the person receiving the spam. This problem is that spam is a widely adopted for phishing and instigating Trojan horses that might spread viruses and other detrimental software. <br><br>
									<strong>Protection and Cures: defenses against invasions via network connections</strong> <br><br>
									
									<strong> 1. Firewall</strong> <br><br>
									
									A primary prevention technique is called firewall, which is a system that provides network security by filtering incoming and outgoing network traffic based on a set of user-defined rules. The purpose of a firewall is to reduce or eliminate unwanted network communications while allowing all legitimate communication to flow freely. Firewalls are also used to protect individual computers rather than entire networks or domains. <br>
									Another common role of a firewall at a gateway is to block all incoming messages that have origin addresses within the region accessed through the gateway because such a message would indicate that an outsider is pretending to be a member of the inside region. Masquerading as a party other than one’s self is known as spoofing. <br>Some variations of firewalls are designed for specific purpose. Ex.: 

									<ol style="list-style: lower-alpha;">
										<li>Spam filters: firewalls designed to block unwanted emai.</li>
										<li>Firewall proxy server: acts as a gateway between you and the internet. Proxy servers act as a firewall and web filter, provide shared network connections, and cache data to speed up common requests.Without a proxy server, a client communicates directly with a server, meaning that the server has an opportunity to learn a certain amount about the client. 
											<ul style="list-style: circle;">
												<li>What are the advantages of a proxy server? 
													<ol>
														<li>The first advantage is that the actual server has no way of knowing that the proxy server is not the true client, and in fact, it is never aware of the actual client’s existence. In turn, the actual server has no way of learning about the intranet’s internal features.</li>
														<li>The second advantage is that the proxy server is in position to filter all the messages sent from the server to the client. For example, an FTP proxy server could check all incoming files for the presence of known viruses and block all infected files.</li>
													</ol>
												</li>
											</ul>
											<ul>
												<li>Great video about Proxy server: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cPIukqXe5w">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cPIukqXe5w</a></li>

											</ul>
										</li>
									</ol>

									<strong>2. Network auditing software</strong><br><br> With this tool, a system administrator can detect a sudden increase in message traffic at various locations within the administrator’s realm, monitor the activities of the system’s firewalls, and analyze the pattern of requests being made by the computers in order to detect irregularities. In effect, auditing software is an administrator’s primary tool for identifying problems before they grow out of control. <br><br>
									<strong>3. Antivirus software</strong><br><br> Antivirus software is used to detect and remove the presence of known viruses and other infections, protecting your computer against malware and cybercriminals. Antivirus software looks at data — web pages, files, software, applications — traveling over the network to your devices. It searches for known threats and monitors the behavior of all programs, flagging suspicious behavior. <br>
										<div style="padding: 20%;padding-top: 0px;padding-bottom: 0px;">
											<p class="quotes" style="text-align: justify;padding: 20px;color:  #084d6e;">“Just as in the case of biological systems, new computer infections are constantly coming on the scene that require updated vaccines. Thus, antivirus software must be routinely maintained by downloading updates from the software’s vendor. Even this, however, does not guarantee the safety of a computer. After all, a new virus must first infect some computers before it is discovered and a vaccine is produced”( Brookshear, 2018)</p>
										</div>
									

									<strong>Cryptography: an essential tool for protecting information in computer systems</strong> <br><br>
									Cryptography is a method of protecting information and communications through the use of codes, so that only those for whom the information is intended can read and process it. Cryptographic tools such as encryption can be used to transform a message into a coded version such that even if the encrypted data fall into unscrupulous hands, the encoded information will remain confidential. <br>
									Today, many traditional Internet applications incorporate cryptographic techniques, producing “secure versions” of the applications. <br>
									EXAMPLE: the secure version of HTTP, known as HTTPS, which is used by most financial institutions to provide customers with secure Internet access to their accounts. The backbone of HTTPS is the protocol system known as Transport Layer Security (TLS), a successor to Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), which was originally developed by Netscape to provide secure communication links between Web clients and servers. <br>
									HTTPS and SSL use symmetric-key encryption techniques to secure web transactions all over the Internet. <br><br>
									<strong>Symmetric Key and Public Key Encryption</strong> <br><br>
									
									An encryption key is a series of numbers used to encrypt and decrypt data. Encryption keys are created with algorithms. There are two types of encryption systems: <br><br>
									<ul>
										<li>Symmetric-key encryption:</li>
									</ul>
									Uses a single password to encrypt and decrypt data. It is a method of encryption involving one key for encryption and decryption. The same key is used for both encoding and decoding a message, provide increasing security because computers are able to work with large, seemingly random keys. <br><br>
									<ul>
										<li>Asymmetric cryptography (or Public-key encryption)</li>
									</ul>
									Uses pairs of keys: public keys, which may be disseminated widely, and private keys, which are known only to the owner. The public key is used to encrypt messages and the private key is required to decrypt messages. Public key encryption is an encryption method that is widely used because of the enhanced security associated with its use. Effective security only requires keeping the private key private; the public key can be openly distributed without compromising security. <br>
									In such a system, any person can encrypt a message using the receiver's public key, but that encrypted message can only be decrypted with the receiver's private key. <br>
									A disadvantage of public-key encryption is that is slower than other methods, such as secret-key encryption. In secret-key encryption, a single key provides that only way to encrypt and decrypt, simplifying and speeding up the process. <br><br>
									<strong>What is Public-key authentication?</strong> <br><br> It is based on the use of public-key (asymmetric) cryptography. The motivation for using public key authentication over simple passwords is security. Public key authentication provides cryptographic strength that even extremely long passwords cannot offer. Public key authentication is an alternative means of identifying yourself to a login server, instead of typing a password. Public key authentication allows automated, passwordless login. <br><br>
									<ul>
										<li>
											Great video: “Symmetric Key and Public Key Encryption”
											<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERp8420ucGs&t=162s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERp8420ucGs&t=162s</a>
										</li>
									</ul>
									<strong>Digital signature</strong><br><br>
									In order to make public-key authentication practical, the digital signature was invented. A digital signature is simply a hash of the data to be sent encrypted using the public-key authentication method.

											Phishing is a type of attack often used to steal user data. It occurs when an attacker, masquerading as a trusted entity, dupes a victim into opening an email, instant message, or text message. <br>
											Phishing is a technique of obtaining information explicitly by simply asking for it. It is often carried out via email messages posing as a financial institution, a government bureau, or perhaps a law enforcement agency. The email asks the victim for information that will be used for hostile purposes. <br>
											Here goes a list of 10 ways to protect against phishing attacks: <br>
											Top Ten Ways to Protect Yourself Against Phishing Attacks, by <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/author/roderick/">Roderick Bauer</a>
										</li> <br>
										<li><strong>What distinction is there between the types of firewalls that can be placed at a domain’s gateway as opposed to an individual host within the domain?</strong><br><br>
											Firewalls are categorized as: network-based or host-based system. Let’s see: <br> 
											While Network Based Firewall filters traffic going from Internet to secured LAN and vice versa, a host based firewall is a software application or suite of applications installed on a single computer and provides protection to the host.
										</li> <br>
										<li><strong>Technically, the term data refers to representations of information, whereas information refers to the underlying meaning. Does the use of passwords protect data or information? Does the use of encryption protect data or information?</strong><br><br>
										<strong>Data X Information</strong>
										<ul style="list-style: circle;">
											<li><strong>Data</strong> is an individual unit that contains raw material which does not carry any specific meaning.</li>
											<li><strong>Information</strong> is a group of data that collectively carry a logical meaning.</li>
										</ul>
										Data is the base to create the information. Without the data, there is no information. Hence, the information is always way more useful than the data. For instance, consider the number: 04011994.
										<br>
										This figure is a data entity and doesn’t provide any meaning. To convert this data into information we need to keep it in some context. Let’s think of a context like a birthdate – 04/01/1994 i.e;  Jan 04 1994.
										<br><br>
										<strong>Password X Encryption</strong>
										<ul style="list-style: circle;">
											<li><strong>Password</strong> protection means only authorized users can access the desired information.</li>
											<li><strong>Encryption</strong> is a level up from password protection and is more secure than passwords because sensitive information or data is encrypted or hidden using an algorithm and a key.</li>
										</ul>
										When data is password protected, it's as if you've gathered all of your data, in its original, readable form, put it into a lock box, and locked the box with a password or passcode. <br>
										Encryption is the process of taking plain text, like a text message or email, and scrambling it into an unreadable format — called “cipher text.” This helps protect the confidentiality of digital data either stored on computer systems or transmitted through a network like the internet.
										</li><br>
										<li><strong>What advantage does public-key encryption have over more traditional encryption techniques?</strong><br><br>
											The primary advantage of public-key cryptography is increased security. Public key cryptography remains the most secure protocol (over private key cryptography) because users never need to reveal their private keys to anyone. This reduces the chances of cyber criminals discovering an individual's secret key during the transmission. In a secret-key system, by contrast, the secret keys must be transmitted (either manually or through a communication channel), and there may be a chance that an enemy can discover the secret keys during their transmission.
											<ul style="list-style: circle;">
												<li>Public key cryptography - requires each user to be responsible for protecting his private key.</li>
												<li>Private key systems - require users to share secret keys and perhaps even trust third parties for transmission.
												</li>
											</ul>
											Another major advantage of public-key systems is that they can provide a method for digital signatures, which is a form of electronic signature that further improves the security and authentication of the signature.
										</li><br>
										<li><strong>What problems are associated with legal attempts to protect against network security problems?</strong><br><br>
											Legal remedies are a way of enhancing the security of computer networking systems. However, there are two obstacles to this approach:
											<ol>
												<li>The first is that making an action illegal does not stop the action. All it does is provide a legal recourse.</li>
												<li>The second is that what is illegal in one country might be legal in another. Ultimately, enhancing network security by legal means is an international project, and thus, must be handled by international legal bodies. A potential player would be the International Court of Justice in The Hague.</li>

								<h2 id="unit-1-5">5. Social Impact of Database Technology</h2>

								<p><strong>What are database technologies?</strong> <br><br> Database technologies take information and store, organize, and process it in a way that enables users to easily and intuitively go back and find details they are searching for. Security and privacy concerns arise with data containing personal information. The legal and ethical ramifications are enormous.  In some cases, the data collection process is readily apparent; in others it is subtle: 
									<ul style="list-style: circle;">
										<li><strong>Data collection process that is apparent</strong> = when one is voluntarily providing information, such as in surveys or contest registration forms.</li>
										<li><strong>Data collection process that is subtle</strong> = when one is providing information in an involuntary manner, such as when imposed by government regulations.</li>
									</ul>
									Sometimes whether it is voluntary or not depends on one’s point of view. For example: Is providing personal information when applying for a loan voluntary or involuntary? The distinction depends on whether receiving the loan is a convenience or a necessity. <br>
									In some cases, the subject of the data collection might not be aware that information is being collected and less likely to be aware of the existence of the databases being constructed:
									<ul style="list-style: none;">
										<li>Ex.1: To use a credit card at many retailers now requires that you allow your signature to be recorded in a digitized format. Again, providing the information is either voluntary or involuntary depending on your situation.</li>
										<li>Ex.2: A credit company that records the purchasing practices of the holders of its credit cards. </li>
										<li>Ex. 3: Websites that record the identities of those who visit the site.</li>
										<li>Ex.4: Social activists who record the license plate numbers on the cars parked in a targeted institution’s parking lot. </li>
									</ul>
									Sometimes the underlying data-collection activities are self-evident.
									<ul style="list-style: none;">
										<li>Ex.: a grocery store might offer discounts to its regular customers who register in advance with the store. The registration process might involve the issuance of identification cards that must be presented at the time of purchase to obtain the discount. The result is that the store is able to compile a record of the customers’ purchases—a record whose value far exceeds the value of the discounts awarded.
										</li>
									</ul>
									<strong>What is the value of the data?</strong><br><br>
									The force driving this boom in data collection is the value of the data, which is amplified by advances in database technology. These technologies can allow data to be linked in ways that reveal information that would otherwise remain obscure. 
									<ul style="list-style: none;">
										<li>Ex.1: The purchasing patterns of credit card holders can be classified and cross-listed to obtain customer profiles of immense marketing value.</li>
										<li>Ex.2: Subscription forms for body-building magazines can be mailed to those who have recently purchased exercise equipment, whereas subscription forms for dog obedience magazines can be targeted toward those who have recently purchased dog food.</li>
									</ul>
									<strong>How to protect society from abusive use of databases?</strong><br><br>
									There are several approaches to protecting society from abusive use of databases. One is to apply legal remedies. Unfortunately, passing a law against an action does not stop the action from occurring but merely makes the action illegal. <br>
									Another approach to controlling database abuse is public opinion. Databases will not be abused if the penalties outweigh the benefits; and the penalty businesses fear the most is adverse public opinion. 
									<ul style="list-style: none;">
										<li>Ex.1: In the early 1990s, it was public opinion that ultimately stopped major credit bureaus from selling mailing lists for marketing purposes.</li>
										<li>Ex.2: Google discontinued its Google Buzz social networking tool in 2011 after its automatic sharing of contact information from the popular Gmail tool was greeted with harsh public criticism. </li>
										<li>Ex.3: In 1997, the Social Security Administration in the United States modified its plan to make social security records available via the Internet when public opinion questioned the security of the information. </li>
									</ul>
									In some of these cases, results were obtained in days; a stark contrast to the extended time periods associated with legal processes. Of course, in many cases, database applications are beneficial to both the holder and the subject of the data, but in all cases, there is a loss of privacy that should not be taken lightly. Such privacy issues are serious when the information is accurate, but they become gigantic when the information is erroneous.

									</ul>
									Computing professionals include hardware designers, software engineers, database administrators, system analysts, and computer scientists.The professional obligations are called professional ethics. <br>
									Within the discipline of philosophy, ethics encompasses the study of the actions that a responsible individual should choose, the values that an honorable individual should espouse, and the character that a virtuous individual should have. For example, everyone should be honest, fair, kind, civil, respectful, and trustworthy. Besides these general obligations that everyone shares, professionals have additional obligations that originate from the responsibilities of their professional work and their relationships with clients, employers, other professionals, and the public. <br>
									The ethical obligations of computing professionals go beyond complying with laws or regulations; laws often lag behind advances in technology. <br><br>
									Ex.: Before the passage of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 in the United States, government officials did not require a search warrant to collect personal information transmitted over computer communication networks. Nevertheless, even in the absence of a privacy law before 1986, computing professionals should have been aware of the ob.

									<strong>What are the responsibilities of computing professionals?</strong>	
									 <br><br>
									<ol style="list-style: lower-alpha;">
										<li>Responsibilities to Clients and Users <br><br>
											Whether a computing professional works as a consultant to an individual or as an employee in a large organization, the professional standards include not only attention to technical excellence but also concern for the social effects of computers on operators, users, and the public. <br>
											When assessing the capabilities and risks of computer systems, the professional must report all relevant findings honestly and accurately. When designing a new computer system, the professional must consider not only the specifications of the client but also how the system might affect the quality of life of users and others. <br>
											Ex.:  A computing professional who designs an information system for a hospital and should allow speedy access by physicians and nurses and yet protect patients’ medical records from unauthorized access; the technical requirement to provide fast access may conflict with the social obligation to ensure patients’ privacy.
										</li><br>
										<li>Responsibilities to Other Professionals  <br><br>
											Although everyone deserves respect from everyone else, when professionals interact with each other, they should demonstrate a kind of respect called collegiality. For example, when one professional uses the ideas of a second professional, the first should credit the second. In a research article, an author gives credit by properly citing the sources of ideas from other authors in previously published articles. Using these ideas without attribution constitutes plagiarism. 
										</li><br>
										<li>Responsibilities to the Public <br><br>
											According to engineering codes of ethics, the engineer’s most important obligation is to ensure the safety, health, and welfare of the public. Computing professionals share this special obligation to guarantee the safety of the public and to improve the quality of life of those who use computers and information systems. <br>
											As part of this obligation, computing professionals should enhance the public’s understanding of computing. The responsibility to educate the public is a collective responsibility of the computing profession as a whole; individual professionals might fulfill this responsibility in their own ways. <br>
											Ex.: Advising a church on the purchase of computing equipment and writing a letter to the editor of a newspaper about technical issues related to proposed legislation to regulate the Internet. <br>
											When a technical professional’s obligation of loyalty to the employer conflicts with the obligation to ensure the safety of the public, the professional may consider whistlebhwing, that is, alerting people outside the employer’s organization to a serious, imminent threat to public safety.

									<strong>Abstract</strong><br><br>
									
									While the ethics of technology is analyzed across disciplines from science and technology studies (STS), engineering, computer science, critical management studies, and law, less attention is paid to the role that firms and managers play in the design, development, and dissemination of technology across communities and within their firm. Although firms play an important role in the development of technology, and make associated value judgments around its use, it remains open how we should understand the contours of what firms owe society as the rate of technological development accelerates. We focus here on digital technologies: devices that rely on rapidly accelerating digital sensing, storage, and transmission capabilities to intervene in human processes. This symposium focuses on how firms should engage ethical choices in developing and deploying these technologies. In this introduction, we, first, identify themes the symposium articles share and discuss how the set of articles illuminate diverse facets of the intersection of technology and business ethics. Second, we use these themes to explore what business ethics offers to the study of technology and, third, what technology studies offers to the field of business ethics. Each field brings expertise that, together, improves our understanding of the ethical implications of
									technology. Finally we introduce each of the five papers, suggest future research directions, and interpret their implications for business ethics. <br><br>

									<strong>Part 4: What is computer ethics?</strong><br><br>
									<ul><li>
										Reference: Moor, J. H. (1985) What is computer ethics? Metaphilosophy 16(4): 266–275.
									</li></ul>
									In his article “What Is Computer Ethics?” (1985), James Moor discusses what makes computers different from other tech nology and how this difference makes a difference in ethical consideration. <br>According to his view, computer ethics is the analysis of the nature and social impact of computer technology and the corresponding formulation and justification of policies for the ethical use of such technology. He defined computer ethics as a field concerned with “policy vacuums” and “conceptual muddles” regarding the social and ethical use of information technology: <br>
									<div style="padding: 20%;padding-top: 0px;padding-bottom: 0px;">
										<p class="quotes" style="text-align: justify;padding: 20px;color:  #084d6e;">A typical problem in Computer Ethics arises because there is a policy vacuum about how computer technology should be used. Computers provide us with new capabilities and these in turn give us new choices for action. Often, either no policies for conduct in these situations exist or existing policies seem inadequate. A central task of Computer Ethics is to determine what we should do in such cases, that is, formulate policies to guide our actions. Of course, some ethical situations confront us as individuals and some as a society. Computer ethics includes consideration of both personal and social policies for the ethical use of computer technology. (Moor 1985, p. 266)</p>
									</div>
									It may seem that all that needs to be done is the mechanical applica tion of an ethical theory to generate the appropriate policy. But this is usually not possible. What is needed is an analysis which provides a coherent conceptual framework within which to formulate a policy for action. Indeed, much of the import ant work in computer ethics is devoted to proposing conceptual frameworks for understanding ethical problems involving computer technology. <br>On his view, computer ethics is a dynamic and complex field of study which considers the relationships among facts, conceptualizations, policies and values with regard to constantly changing computer technology. Computer ethics requires us to think anew about the nature of computer technology and our values. Although computer ethics is a field between science and ethics and depends on them, it is also a discipline in its own right which provides both conceptualizations for understanding and policies for using computer technology. <br>Moor claims that computer technology is genuinely revolutionary because it is “logically malleable”:
									<div style="padding: 20%;padding-top: 0px;padding-bottom: 0px;">
										<p class="quotes" style="text-align: justify;padding: 20px;color:  #084d6e;">Computers are logically malleable in that they can be shaped and molded to do any activity that can be characterized in terms of inputs, outputs and connecting logical operations. Logical operations are the precisely defined steps which take a computer from one state to the next. (…) Because logic applies everywhere, the potential applications of computer technology appear limitless. The computer is the nearest thing we have to a universal tool. Indeed, the limits of computers are largely the limits of our own creativity. (Moor 1985, p. 269)
										</p>
									</div>
									The driving question of the Computer Revolution is "How can we mold the logic of computers to better serve our purposes?" He says that logical malleability explains the already widespread application of computers and hints at the enormous impact computers are destined to have. <br>
									Logical malleability has both a syntactic and a semantic dimension. Syntactically, the logic of computers is malleable in terms of the number and variety of possible states and operations. Semantically, the logic of computers is malleable in that the states of the computer can be taken to represent anything. Computers manipulate symbols but they don't care what the symbols represent. Thus, there is no ontological basis for giving preference to numerical applications over non numerical applications. 
									<br>
									The fact that computers can be described in mathematical language, even at a very low level, doesn't make them essentially numerical. For example, machine language is conveniently and traditionally expressed in 0's and l's. But the 0's and l's simply designate different physical states. We could label these states as "on" and "off' or "yin" and "yang" and apply binary logic. <br>
									Obviously, it is useful to use mathematical notation to describe computer operations. The mistake is to reify the mathematical notation as the essence of a computer and then use this conception to make judgments about the appropriate use of computers. Our conceptions of computer technology will affect our policies for using it.  <br>
									According to Moor, the computer revolution will occur in two stages: <br><br>
									<ol>
										<li>
											The first stage is that of “technological introduction” in which computer technology is developed and refined. This occurred during the first 40 years after the Second World War. 
										</li>
										<li>The second stage is the permeation stage, in which computer technology will become an integral part of institutions throughout our society.</li>
									</ol>
									As computers permeate more and more of our society, we will see more and more of the transforming effect of computers on our basic in situations and practices. Traditional work may no longer be defined as something that normally happens at a specific time or a specific place. Work for us may become less doing a job than instructing a computer to do a job. <br>
									According to the author: 
									<div style="padding: 20%;padding-top: 0px;padding-bottom: 0px;">
										<p class="quotes" style="text-align: justify;padding: 20px;color:  #084d6e;">“As the concept of work begins to change, the values associated with the old concept will have to be reexamined. Executives who work at a computer terminal at home will lose some spontaneous interaction with colleagues. Factory workers who direct robots by pressing buttons may take less pride in a finished product. And similar effects can be expected in other types of work. Commercial pilots who watch computers fly their planes may find their jobs to be different from what they expected.” (Moor 1985, p. 272)
										</p>
									</div>
									In brief, the argument is as follows: The revolutionary feature of computers is their logical malleability. Logical malleability assures the enormous application of computer technology. This will bring about the Computer Revolution. During the Computer Revolution many of our human activities and social institutions will be transformed. These transformations will leave us with policy and conceptual vacuums about how to use computer technology. Such policy and conceptual vacuums are the marks of basic problems within computer ethics. Therefore, computer ethics is a field of substantial practical importance. <br>
									The author claims that most of the time and under most conditions computer operations are invisible. He mentions three kinds of invisibility which can have ethical significance: <br><br>
									<ol>
										<li><strong> Invisible abuse:</strong> is the intentional use of the invisible operations of a computer to engage in unethical conduct. <br>
											Ex.1: A programmer who realized he could steal excess interest from a bank. When interest on an bank account is calculated, there is often a fraction of a cent left over after rounding off. This programmer instructed a computer to deposit these fractions of a cent to his own account.  <br>
											Ex.2: The invasion of the property and privacy of others. A computer can be programmed to contact another computer over phone lines and surreptitiously remove or alter confidential in formation 
											</li>
										<li>
											<strong>Invisible programming values.</strong>Invisible programming values are those values which are embedded in a computer program. In order to implement a program which satisfies the specifications a programmer makes some value judgments about what is important and what is not. These values become embedded in the final product and may be invisible to someone who runs the program. Sometimes invisible programming values are so invisible that even the programmers are unaware of them. Programs may have bugs or may be based on implicit assumptions which don't become obvious until there is a crisis. 
										</li>
										<li>
											<strong>Invisible complex calculation.</strong> Computers today are capable of enormous calculations beyond human comprehension. Even if a program is understood, it does not follow that the calculations based on that program are understood. Computers can perform calculations which are too complex for human inspection and understanding. <br>
											
											In terms of efficiency the invisibility factor is a blessing. But it is just this invisibility that makes us vulnerable. We are open to invisible abuse or invisible programming of inappropriate values or invisible miscalculation. The challenge for computer ethics is to formulate policies which will help us deal with this dilemma. We must decide when to trust computers and when not to trust them. This is another reason why computer ethics is so important.

									<strong>The GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)</strong>
									The <strong>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</strong> is a regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy in the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA). It also addresses the transfer of personal data outside the EU and EEA areas. The GDPR's primary aim is to give control to individuals over their personal data and to simplify the regulatory environment for international business by unifying the regulation within the EU. <br>
									The GDPR is an EU data privacy law that went into effect May 25, 2018. It is designed to give individuals more control over how their data are collected, used, and protected online. It also binds organizations to strict new rules about using and securing the personal data they collect from people, including the mandatory use of technical safeguards like encryption and higher legal thresholds to justify data collection. Organizations that don’t comply will face heavy penalties of up to 4 percent of their global annual revenue or €20 million, whichever is higher. <br>
									However, data breaches are not the only things that lead to regulatory action. There are two levels of GDPR fines: <br><br>
									<strong>Lower level of GDPR penalties:</strong> Fines of up to €10 million or 2% of annual global turnover can be issued for infringements of articles:
									<ul>
										<li>8 (conditions for children’s consent);</li>
										<li>11 (processing that doesn’t require identification);</li>
										<li>25 – 39 (general obligations of processors and controllers);</li>
										<li>42 (certification);</li>
										<li>43 (certification bodies);</li>
									</ul>

									<strong>Higher level of GDPR penalties:</strong>Fines of up to €20 million or 4% of annual global turnover can be issued for infringements of articles:
									<ul>
										<li>5 (data processing principles);</li>
										<li>6 (lawfulness of processing);</li>
										<li>7 (conditions for consent);</li>
										<li>9 (processing of special categories of data);</li>
										<li>12 – 22 (data subjects’ rights);</li>
										<li>44 – 49 (data transfers to third countries or international organisations);</li>
									</ul>
									<strong>Who does the data protection law apply to?</strong>
									The GDPR applies to: <br><br>
									<ol>
										<li>a company or entity which processes personal data as part of the activities of one of its branches established in the EU, regardless of where the data is processed; or</li>
										<li>a company established outside the EU and is offering goods/services (paid or for free) or is monitoring the behavior of individuals in the EU.</li>
									</ol>
									If your company is a small and medium-sized enterprise ('SME') that processes personal data as described above you have to comply with the GDPR. However, if processing personal data isn’t a core part of your business and your activity doesn't create risks for individuals, then some obligations of the GDPR will not apply to you (for example the appointment of a Data Protection Officer ('DPO')). Note that ‘core activities’ should include activities where the processing of data forms an inextricable part of the controller’s or processor’s activities. <br><br>
									<strong>Examples:</strong> <br><br>
									<ul style="list-style: circle;">
										<li><strong>When the regulation applies</strong><br><br>Your company is a small, tertiary education company operating online with an establishment based outside the EU. It targets mainly Spanish and Portuguese language universities in the EU. It offers free advice on a number of university courses and students require a username and a password to access your online material. Your company  provides the said username and password once the students fill out an enrolment form.</li> <br>
										<li><strong>When the regulation does not apply</strong><br><br>
											Your company is service provider based outside the EU. It provides services to customers outside the EU.  Its clients can use its services when they travel to other countries, including within the EU. Provided your company doesn't specifically target its services at individuals in the EU, it is not subject to the rules of the GDPR.
										</li>
									</ul>
									<strong>When and how the GDPR applies outside the EU?</strong> <br>
									There are two scenarios in which a non-EU organization might have to comply with the GDPR. Let’s take a closer look at each of these. <br><br>
									<ol style="list-style: lower-alpha;">
										<li><strong>Offering goods or services</strong><br>
											The Internet makes goods and services in far-flung places accessible anywhere in the world. Regulators have to examine the situation in order to determine whether the organization set out to offer goods and services to people in the EU. To do so, they’ll look for things like whether, for example, a Canadian company created ads in German or included pricing in euros on its website.
											<ul style="list-style: circle;">
												<li>In short: if your company is not in the EU but you cater to EU customers, then you should strive to be GDPR compliant.</li>

											<strong>Monitoring their behavior</strong><br>
											If your organization uses web tools that allow you to track cookies or the IP addresses of people who visit your website from EU countries, then you fall under the scope of the GDPR.
											<ul style="list-style: circle;">
												<li>Ex.: you run a golf course in Manitoba focused exclusively on your local area, but sometimes people in France stumble across your site. Would you find yourself in the crosshairs of European regulators? It’s not likely. But technically you could be held accountable for tracking these data.</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
									</ol>
									<ul>
										<li><strong>Exceptions to the rule</strong><br>
											There are two important exceptions to the rule. 
											<ol>
												<li>The GDPR only applies to organizations engaged in “professional or commercial activity.” The GDPR does not apply to “purely personal or household activity.” So if you’ve collected emails to organize a picnic with friends from work, you will not have to comply with the GDPR . If you’re collecting emails from friends to fundraise a side business project, then the GDPR may apply to you.</li>
												<li>The second exception is for organizations with fewer than 250 employees. Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are not totally exempt from the GDPR, but the regulation does free them from record-keeping obligations in most cases (Article 30.5).</li>

											<strong>Marriott International 2020 Data Breach</strong> <br><br>
										</div>
										<strong>Introduction: about the GDPR</strong> <br><br>
										The GDPR is an EU data privacy law that went into effect May 25, 2018. It is designed to give individuals more control over how their data are collected, used, and protected online. It also binds organizations to strict new rules about using and securing the personal data they collect from people, including the mandatory use of technical safeguards like encryption and higher legal thresholds to justify data collection. <br>
										Organizations that don’t comply can face heavy penalties of up to 4 percent of their global annual revenue or €20 million, whichever is higher.  However, it is important to observe that not all GDPR infringements lead to data protection fines. Supervisory authorities can take a range of other actions, including: issuing warnings and reprimands; imposing a temporary or permanent ban on data processing; ordering the rectification, restriction or erasure of data; and Suspending data transfers to third countries. <br>
										The GDPR applies to: a) a company or entity which processes personal data as part of the activities of one of its branches established in the EU, regardless of where the data is processed; b) a company established outside the EU and is offering goods/services (paid or for free) or is monitoring the behavior of individuals in the EU. 
										The GDPR defines a ‘personal data breach’ as “a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data”. In short, a ‘data breach’ is a security incident in which information is accessed without authorization. Data breach represents a true risk for businesses and customers. It can affect people’s lives as well as damage a company reputation. <br><br>
										
										<strong>Marriott 2020 Data Breach: what exactly happened?</strong><br><br>
										In mid-January 2020, Marriott International suffered a new data breach, which affected around 5.2 million guests. This is the second data breach by Marriott in recent years following a breach in 2018. The breach was identified at the end of February 2020 and dates back to mid-January 2020. Marriott said it discovered in late February that the network of an unspecified hotel chain had been hacked. Hackers who obtained the login credentials of two Marriott employees may have accessed the guest details. The breach may have taken personal information such as names, birthdates, and telephone numbers, along with language preferences and loyalty account numbers. <br><br>
										Marriott said it contacted guests whose details may have been taken via email and launched a website dedicated to those affected ((www.mysupport.marriott.com). The company offered the program for tracking the personal information of visitors whose details could have been compromised. Marriott encourages investors, the media, and others interested in the company to review and subscribe to the information Marriott posts on these websites, which may be material. <br><br>
										Marriott International has a long-standing commitment to transparency and integrity in its corporate governance practices. Still, this incident revealed Marriot had broken its Code of Conduct, especially the following rule: <br>
									
										“We expect and encourage our suppliers to (…) Respect and treat the business and personal information of others with the utmost discretion.” <br>Business Conduct and Ethics <br><br>
										<strong>What can the Hotel Industry do to avoid data breaches like Marriott’s?</strong>
										<br><br>
										To suffer one data breach may be regarded as a mistake; to suffer two in less than two years looks like carelessness. The firm has learned important cybersecurity lessons, and all organizations could stand to learn from its experience. Here goes a list of what the Hotel Industry do to avoid data breaches like Marriott’s:  <br><br>
										<ol>
											<li><strong>Develop a Security-Centric Culture at the Top Level</strong><br> A security-centric mindset ensures a severe approach to customer data security.</li>
											<li><strong>Stay ahead of the security curve</strong><br>Companies should be proactive in customer data security products, continually reviewing and trying new developments to stay ahead of hackers.</li>
											<li><strong>Make your security spend for customer data security unbudgeted.</strong><br> Invest whatever it takes to protect sensitive customer data. Yes, stay within your financial metrics, but don’t cap the budget, because capping it means you’re compromising. Give the security team whatever they request to protect the brand.</li>
											<li><strong>Recognize that customer data security is not a cost center but a revenue center.</strong><br>Companies need to understand that customer data security is part of the revenue center, not the cost center. With better security, you are not only preventing breaches, but you are also building trust within your customer base to generate more revenue.</li>
