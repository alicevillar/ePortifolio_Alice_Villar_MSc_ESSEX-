									<p>I am Alice Villar, a Brazilian lawyer and published author, currently doing a MSc in Computer Science. The MSc at the University of Essex was precisely what I was seeking. It covers a broad range of modules to develop my technical knowledge and practical skills while learning various essential computer topics. I have always been fascinated by the computer industry, and I am also doing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I am a motivated and diligent student who has always accomplished my goals to the best degree. So far, my academic experience has provided me with skills that are immensely useful in the Computer Science field. First is to be resilient and determined in the face of the massive amount of study and effort necessary to become a Computer Scientist. Secondly, reading became an everyday ritual for me, and I know it is critical to scientific research because it generates passion for science.</p>

									<p>Using my strength for researching, I managed to publish 70 articles on Legal Magazines and three Law Books: "Direito Sumular-STF," "Direito Sumular-STJ," and "Direito Bancário." The first two books are about jurisprudence and have a Preface written by Luis Fux, a Justice Minister of The Supreme Federal Court. The third book is about Banking Law and has a Preface written by Luis Felipe Salomão, a Justice Minister of The Superior Court of Justice.</p>
									<p>Throughout these years, I've practiced Yoga and Meditation, which has always helped me develop inner strength and overcome hardships to accomplish my goals. I am also a Yoga teacher certified through the International Sivananda Yoga Teachers' Training Course (TTC), which shares teachings of classical Hatha Yoga and Vedanta (Yoga Philosophy) as a means for all to achieve physical, mental, and spiritual wellbeing, and self-realization.</p>
									<p>In 2018, I completed the Sivananda Yoga Teachers' Training Course (TTC) and the Advanced Teacher Training Course (ATTC), which helped me to deepen my spiritual practice and study of Hatha Yoga, Vedanta philosophy and Raja Yoga. I completed both courses at Sivananda Ashram Yoga Camp in Val-Morin, Quebec (Canada) and I’m currently a Registered Yoga Teacher with Yoga Alliance Foundation (YA ID: 249811 - E-RYT 500).</p>
									<p>I am the founder of ANANDAMAYI YOGA, a Registered Yoga School (RYS-200) and Continuing Education Provider (YACEP). I have authored the following Yoga books: "The Sun Salutation: a guide to turning your practice into a deep meditation," "The 32 Fundamental Asanas and their variations", "The 47 life benefits of Yoga: achieving self-development in physical, mental, and spiritual levels".</p>
